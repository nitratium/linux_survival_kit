# File Descriptors
  * File descriptors (FDs) are like pointers to sources data can be read or places data can be written. There are three file descriptors:
    * Standart Input (stdin): FD 0
    * Standart Output (stdout): FD 1
    * Standart Error (stderr): FD 2

  * Standart Input is your keyboard basically. Standart Output is where the program returns its output and Standart Error is where the program sends its error messages. Mostly Standart Output and Standart Error directed to your terminal by default. But we can redirect them. Does it sounds meaningless? If yes, then you are going to understand what it is with following examples don't worry. Just keep going. These are just definitions, mostly they don't make sense, aren't they? :)
