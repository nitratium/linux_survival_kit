# First things first welcome to my Linux guide! It is so great to see you here.

* For better learning i strongly advise you to download and install your favorite Linux distribution and try the stuff on your own terminal emulator.

* If you don't have any idea about any Linux distribution, don't worry. I had no idea as well. You can start with Ubuntu distribution. I bet you heard about it. It is easy to install into your hardware or virtual machine. There are lots of visiual tutorials on installing Ubuntu. 

* Once you get into graphical interface everything is similar to Windows. Even simpler, trust me. There is nothing to be scared.

* You might have used a Linux distribution already and you may not even know. Android is a mobile operating system based on a modified version of the Linux kernel.

* I also started with Ubuntu Linux and learned everything I will show you here in Ubuntu's terminal. Right now I am using Kali Linux because I am studying on its tools. If you see a different terminal interface, don't worry. I am just using an another distribution. Everything is same except the visiual.

* See you on the next document!
