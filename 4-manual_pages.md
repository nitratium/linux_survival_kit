# Manual Pages
 * Linux has manual pages for most of the commands. With "man" command we are able to look into manual page for a spesific command.

 ```
 $ man cal
 ```
 * This command will open manual page for **cal** command.

 * If we want to find a new command for a usage, we can search through manual pages with -k option.
 ```
 $ man -k <search term>
 ```
 * This will return the commands containing the search term in its name or description.
