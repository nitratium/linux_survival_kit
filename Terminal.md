# So the famous Terminal...

*** Firstly, I need to inform you about something. You know the terminal on Linux right? Well, it's not a terminal.

* Let's open the terminal. You can open your terminal with graphical interface basically clicking on its icon on your favorites menu. When you install Ubuntu terminal icon comes as stock on your favorites menu or taskbar with Windows slang. Or you can use the shortcut <CTRL + ALT + T> to open your terminal.

* I am hoping that you managed to open your terminal :).
