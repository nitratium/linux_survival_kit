# So the famous Terminal...

*** Firstly, I need to inform you about something. You know the terminal on Linux right? Well, it's not a terminal.

* Let's open the terminal. You can open your terminal with graphical interface basically clicking on its icon on your favorites menu. When you install Ubuntu terminal icon comes as stock on your favorites menu or taskbar with Windows slang. Or you can use the shortcut **CTRL + ALT + T** to open your terminal.

* I am hoping that you managed to open your terminal :). 

* Okay, welcome to your terminal. This console allows you to use your computer fully functionally with only typing commands. If you know how to use it, of course.

* Lets try some easy commands for start. 

# ABOUT COMMAND STRUCTURE

# echo Command
* If you have programming experience this thing basically does what a **print()** does. If you don't have any programming experience it is still so easy. Give it an input and it will return what you gave it.

```
echo Hello World!
Hello World!
```

* You might think why do I need something like this it just mirrors me. Well yes for now it is useless but we can redirect outputs to other commands or to files. With this power it gains meaning. We will discuss redirection in detail later, don't worry about it now.
